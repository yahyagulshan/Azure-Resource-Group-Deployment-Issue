**Troubleshooting Azure Resource Group Deployment**

Issue: The process becomes stuck during the database step when deploying resources to an Azure resource group. An error message is displayed:

Error Message: "Operation on server 'abcdef-database' and database 'abcdef-database' is in progress. Please wait a few minutes before trying again."

Resolution:

Immediate Action: Retry the deployment after waiting for a couple of minutes. The error message may be due to a temporary server operation or database update.
Check for Azure Maintenance: It's possible that Azure is performing maintenance, patching, or updates in the background. These activities can temporarily affect deployment processes. Waiting for a while can often resolve the issue.
