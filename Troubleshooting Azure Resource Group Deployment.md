<strong>**Resolution**:</strong>


<strong style="color: red; opacity: 0.80;">**Immediate Action**:</strong> Retry the deployment after waiting for a couple of minutes. The error message may be due to a temporary server operation or database update.

<strong style="color: red; opacity: 0.80;">**Check for Azure Maintenance**:</strong> It's possible that Azure is performing maintenance, patching, or updates in the background. 
These activities can temporarily affect deployment processes. Waiting for a while can often resolve the issue.
