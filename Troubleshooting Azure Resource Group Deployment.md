# Troubleshooting Azure Resource Group Deployment



<strong style="color: red; opacity: 0.80;">**Issue**:</strong> The process becomes stuck during the database step when deploying resources to an Azure resource group. An error message is displayed

 <strong style="color: red; opacity: 0.80;">Error Message:</strong> 
 <!-- ```diff

``` -->
$${\color{red}"Operation  on  server  'abcdef-database'  and  database 'abcdef-database'  is  in  progress.  Please  wait  a  few  minutes  before  trying  again. \space "}$$




<strong style="color: red; opacity: 0.80;">**Resolution**:</strong>

<strong style="color: red; opacity: 0.80;">**Immediate Action**:</strong> Retry the deployment after waiting for a couple of minutes. The error message may be due to a temporary server operation or database update.

<strong style="color: red; opacity: 0.80;">**Check for Azure Maintenance**:</strong> It's possible that Azure is performing maintenance, patching, or updates in the background. 
These activities can temporarily affect deployment processes. Waiting for a while can often resolve the issue.
